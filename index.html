    <h1> Hello World</h1>
    <p>We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.

        ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT⁠, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
        
        We are excited to introduce ChatGPT to get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses. During the research preview, usage of ChatGPT is free. Try it now at chatgpt.com⁠(opens in a new window).</p>
